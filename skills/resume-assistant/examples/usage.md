| 💬 "Convert my resume to PDF" | Exports to PDF using the professional template |
| 💬 "Score my resume and tell me how to improve" | Scores out of 100 with detailed improvement plan |
| 💬 "What's wrong with my resume?" | Evaluates and identifies key issues to fix |
| 💬 "Here's my resume, can you help?" | Scores first, then suggests next steps |

### Example Conversations

**Creating a new resume:**
```
You:   Create a resume for a frontend engineer position at a startup

Bot:   I'd be happy to help create a tailored resume! To get started, could you
       share the following:
       1. Your work experience (companies, roles, dates, key achievements)
       2. Education background
       3. Technical skills
       4. Any specific job posting you're targeting? (optional but recommended)

You:   I have 3 years of experience at Shopify working on React...
       [provides background details]

Bot:   Here's your tailored resume:
       [generates complete resume using customize workflow]
       
       Would you like me to:
       • Score this resume to see how it rates?
       • Export it to PDF or Word?
       • Polish it further for specific improvements?
```

**Quick improvement:**
```
You:   Here's my resume, what do you think?
       [pastes resume]

Bot:   📊 Resume Score: 68/100 (Grade: C)
       
       Top 3 Issues:
       1. ❌ No quantified achievements — add metrics
       2. ⚠️ Weak action verbs — replace "responsible for" with impact verbs
       3. ⚠️ Missing keywords for your target role
       
       Would you like me to polish it now? I can fix all these issues.

You:   Yes, polish it

Bot:   [runs full polish with 40+ checklist items]
```

**Job-specific tailoring:**
```
You:   Tailor my resume for this job description:
       Senior Backend Engineer at Stripe
       Requirements: Go, distributed systems, payment APIs...

Bot:   🎯 Job Analysis Complete
       📊 Current Match: 62% → After Optimization: 89%
       [generates tailored version with keyword optimization]

**Pro tips:**
1. **Start with scoring** if you have an existing resume — know where you stand
2. **Polish first** to fix all basic issues before customizing
3. **Customize per application** — don't use one resume for all jobs
4. **Score again** after polish + customize to see improvement
5. **Export last** — get content perfect before formatting
6. **Use Markdown** as your working format — it converts cleanly to all others
