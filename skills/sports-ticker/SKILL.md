# Sports Ticker

Track your favorite teams across **multiple sports** with **FREE live alerts**!

Supports: ⚽ Soccer • 🏈 NFL • 🏀 NBA • 🏒 NHL • ⚾ MLB • 🏎 F1

## First Run (Onboarding)

When no `config.json` exists, running the setup script launches an interactive wizard:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py
```

**The wizard asks:**
1. 📺 **Which sports?** — Pick from Soccer, NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, F1
2. 🏆 **Which teams?** — Choose from popular teams or search for any team
3. 🔔 **Alert style?** — Live scores, final only, or daily digest
4. ⏰ **Game-day reminders?** — Get a heads-up 30 mins before kick-off
5. 🌙 **Quiet hours?** — Pause alerts while you sleep

After setup, your `config.json` is ready and you can start tracking!

**Re-run setup anytime:**
```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py --force  # Overwrites existing config
```
