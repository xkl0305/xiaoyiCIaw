## Qualitative Research

### Interview Structure

```
OPENING (5 min):
- Intro & rapport
- Permission to record
- Context setting

CONTEXT (10 min):
- Role and responsibilities
- Day-to-day workflow
- Tools used

DEEP DIVE (20 min):
- "Walk me through [process]..."
- "Tell me about last time [problem]..."
- "What frustrates you most?"

IMPACT (10 min):
- "What happens when [problem]?"
- "How much time/money does it cost?"

FUTURE (10 min):
- "What would ideal look like?"
- "What would you pay for [solution]?"

CLOSING (5 min):

- "Can I follow up?"
```

### Interview Best Practices

- Listen 70%, talk 30%
- Ask "Why?" 5 times

## Quantitative Research

### Survey Design

**Question Types:**
- Rating scale (1-5, 1-10)
- Multiple choice
- Open-ended (limit 1-2)
- Ranking

**NPS Question:**
"How likely are you to recommend [product] to a friend? (0-10)"

### Sample Size Calculator

```
For 95% confidence, 5% margin:
- Population 100 → Sample 80
- Population 500 → Sample 217
- Population 1000 → Sample 278
- Population 10000 → Sample 370
```

## Synthesis

### Affinity Mapping

1. Write each insight on sticky note
2. Group similar insights
3. Name each group (theme)
4. Rank by frequency/impact
5. Extract top 5-10 themes

### Persona Template

```
NAME: [Descriptive name]
ROLE: [Job title, company type]
QUOTE: "[Real quote from research]"

GOALS:
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
