V23.3 Agent Hub Boundary Contract.

agent_kernel is the total orchestrator, not an all-powerful bucket.
It may dispatch, sequence, and summarize, but it must not bypass:
- L5 Governance for risk decisions
- L4 Execution / outbox for real side effects
- L2 Memory Kernel for durable memory writes
- L6 Context Resume / Recovery for interruption recovery
